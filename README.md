# CS33
My programming projects for UCLA's CS33 course

| Project  | Grade |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Data Lab  | 38/38  |
| Bomb Lab (not shown)  | 80/70  |
| Attack Lab (not shown) | 100/100 |
| Malloc Lab | 127/100 |
| Thread Lab | 110/100 |

I achieved extra credit on the Bomb Lab for completing the secret phase and on the Malloc and Thread Lab for greatly exceeding performance expectations.
